The hackathon is focused on building zero-knowledge applications on Mina Protocol with SnarkyJS.   I built a privacy-focused decentralized zkApp that aims to enable anonymous and secure protests where participants can join and support various causes while preserving their privacy.  This hackathon was the most hardcore hackathon I've participated in : joining the hackathon, knowing very little about zero-knowledge (zk) technology, let alone building zk technology.  Throughout the process, I had to dive deep and learn all these new concepts while building my zkApp.  In the end, my project won first place in the hackathon, out of 40 other projects, and this victory provoked me to go further deeper into this tough concept of zero knowledge technology.",
